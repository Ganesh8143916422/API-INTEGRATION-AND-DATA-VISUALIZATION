# API Integration and Data Visualization

## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of integrating data from external APIs and transforming that data into meaningful visualizations. By leveraging Python libraries such as `requests`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`, this project enables automated data fetching, cleaning, and visualization. The goal is to provide an easy-to-follow solution for developers and data analysts who need to extract data from APIs and display it in an insightful, graphical format. This README outlines the project's structure, features, technologies, setup instructions, and how to use the scripts to fetch and visualize data.

## Features
- **API Integration**: Seamlessly connect to a wide variety of APIs, retrieve data, and process it into usable formats. 
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, convert data types, and aggregate data to ensure itâ€™s ready for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, and interactive plots to reveal insights from the data.
- **Real-Time Updates**: If the API provides real-time data, this project allows you to update and visualize the data dynamically.
- **Error Handling**: The integration script gracefully handles API request failures, rate limiting, and unexpected response formats.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used for integration, data processing, and visualization.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to interact with APIs and retrieve data in JSON format.
- **Pandas**: For handling data frames, cleaning, transforming, and aggregating data.
- **Matplotlib**: A core library for creating static, customizable plots.
- **Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, it enhances data visualizations with simple and informative plots, particularly useful for statistical data.
- **Plotly**: An optional library for creating interactive visualizations.
- **JSON**: For parsing the data returned from APIs, typically in JSON format.
